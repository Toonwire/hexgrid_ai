					<h1>Rules</h1>
						<p>Write a script and compete against other AIs in a Batte Royal fight to conquer the hexagonal grid.</p>

						<h3>The setup</h3>
							<ul style="list-style: disc">
								<li>You start with just a single hexagon cell in the grid and 10 resources.</li>
								<li>
									To take over a cell you must transfer resources from a cell that you own one of its neighbors.<br>
									If the amount of resources transferred exceeds that of the targeted cell, you will take control of that cell.
								</li>
								<li>One transaction is available to each player every round.</li>
								<li>After each round all cells occupied by players gain 1 resource.</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>Transaction rules</h3>
							<ul style="list-style: disc">
								<li>Transfered resources must be a non-negative integer.</li>
								<li>You cannot transfer more resources from a cell than is available to that cell.</li>
								<li>Resources can only be transfered from cells that you own.</li>
								<li>Transactions must include distinct cells - i.e. it is not possible for a cell to be both donor and recipient in a transaction.</li>
								<li>The cells of a transaction must be neighbors when attacking (transferring resources from an owned cell to a non-owned cell).</li>
								<li>Transaction between cells that are both owned by the player does not have to be neighbors, although they must still be connected through other cells of that player.</li>
								<li>It is possible for a transaction to cause the receiving cell to exceed its natural growth.</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>Mining field</h3>
							<ul style="list-style: disc">
								<li>Surrounding each player's initial cell are six unoccupied cells with a random amount of resources.</li>
								<li>Getting through the mining field gives access to the rest of the grid, where unoccupied cells are freely available.</li>
								<li>While the mining field resources are randomly generated, they are the same for every player in the grid.</li>
								<li>The mining field resources are shuffled around for each player to spice things up a bit.</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>Super cells</h3>
							<ul style="list-style: disc">
								<li>Regular cells have a maximum natural growth of 100 resources.</li>
								<li>Super cells are cells that will continue to grow until they reach 300 resources.</li>
								<li>Super cells are indicated on the grid with lines across it.</li>
								<li>Super cells are located just beyond the mining field of each player.</li>
							</ul>

					<h1>Documentation</h1>
						<p>To determine how to spend transactions, each player has access to an their owned cells denoted <code>myCells (PlayerCell[])</code>.<br>
						Each algorithm's <code>turn</code> function will be called every round and should return a <code>transaction</code> object.
						</p>

						<h3><code>PlayerCell</code></h3>
							<p>
								<code>id (string)</code>
								<br>Unique identifier for the hexagon cell.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>resources (int)</code>
								<br>Amount of resources available in the cell.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>maxGrowth (int)</code>
								<br>How much the cell will naturally grow before not gaining anymore resources.
							</p>
							<p>
								<!-- <code>owner</code> - <code>(enum HexOwner)</code> The owner of the cell. -->
								<code>neighbors (NeighborCell[])</code>
								<br>Array of neighboring cells.
							</p>

						<h3><code>NeighborCell</code></h3>
							<p>
								<code>id (string)</code>	
								<br>Unique identifier for the hexagon cell.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>resources (int)</code> 
								<br>Amount of resources available in the cell.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>maxGrowth (int)</code>
								<br>How much the cell will naturally grow before not gaining anymore resources.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>owner (enum HexOwner)</code>
								<br>The owner of this cell.
							</p>

						<h3><code>HexOwner</code></h3>
							<p>
								<code>NONE (int)</code> 
								<br>Unoccupied hexagon controlled by no one.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>OWN (int)</code> 
								<br>Hexagon controlled by the player.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>OTHER (int)</code> 
								<br>Hexagon controlled another player.
							</p>

						<h3><code>Transaction</code></h3>
							<p>
								<code>fromId (string)</code> 
								<br>Id of the cell from which resources will be taken.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>toId (string)</code> 
								<br>Id of the cell to receive the resources.
							</p>
							<p>
								<code>transferAmount (int)</code> 
								<br>The amount of resources to be transfered.
